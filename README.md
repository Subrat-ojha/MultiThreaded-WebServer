# MultiThreaded-WebServer
A lightweight multithreaded web server-client system in Java. The server listens on port 8010, handles multiple client connections using threads, and responds with "Hello from the server." The client spawns threads to send messages and print responses. Built with modern Java features, it's ideal for learning socket programming and multithreading.
